# Interview-Solutions Exercise

- Call => python main.py

This will load the sample graph provided in the assignment. Specifically from the train-graph-1.txt,

and then runs the the 10 example inputs.

### Structure and Details

The assignment has been segregated into 4 parts: _graph.py, train_route.py, simple_util.py, and tests.py_

#### Graph.py

Contains only one class, the Graph class. Since train routing and path finding is fundamentally a graphing problem
I felt it was best to separate it to allow it to be more modular and extendable.

There are three major methods and two utility methods.

---

- The three major methods are:

  - \_dijkstra()
  - getWeightPath()
  - getAllPathsBetween()\_

- The two utility methods are:
  - \_modGraph()
  - modUndo()\_
  ***
  The **dijkstra** method is the traditional lowest cost/most effiecent path from a source to a target in a directed weighted graph. This
  function is minimally modified to be able to exit early if the target vertex is reached

The **getWeightPath** method takes a path and returns the weight of the path if the entirety of the path exists
within the graph. If no such path exists, it returns -1. Functionally, this simply looks at each adjacent
pair of nodes and adds up the weight of the corresponding edge.

The **getAllPathsBetween** method is a modified Breadth First Search. In this modification visited vertices are no longer
marked visited. Since vertices are no longer marked visited there needed to be a new way to reduce the queue without missing
potential paths. The solution I developed is create a dictionary whose keys are verticies that mapped to a set of paths
whose final destination is the key.

The solution allows me to keep track-record of paths that have been already been generated and systematically generates new paths, and can easily
prevent the duplication of paths. With the help of the previously mentioned dictionary the queue is only appended to if
at least one new path was generated. And of the newly generated paths at least one path is within the max path length or max
path weight bound. Together, these modificaitons of BFS allows getAllPathsBetween to accurately and efficiently generated
all possible paths between two points bounded by max path length or max path weight.

The **modGraph** method takes a list of tuples each representing starting vertex, ending vertex, edge weight and modifies the
graph either updating a weight, adding a new edge, or removing an edge. The ability to modify the graph allows an efficient
way to compute new paths with consideration of the modification without generating an entirely new graph. Before the
modificaiton is applied the current state of the graph is saved in a stack. This method is paired with modUndo.

The **modUndo** method is called to undo what is done to the graph by the modGraph method. Simply pops the to saved state and
applies the saved state.

#### train_route.py

Containing only one class, and that is TrainRoutes. TrainRoutes class only uses the Graph class.

There are three major methods being used here; _shortestPath(), distPath(), and numDiffPaths()_

The **shortestPath** method, in addition to simply computing lowest weight path using dijkstras provided by Graph, the **shortestPath** method can also compute lowest weight and the round trip too. Since dijkstras will return zero on the shortest path from A to A. Computing lowest weight
round trip using dijkstras requires a modification in the following way. Finding all inward edges towards the source, and duplicating those
edges to also point towards an artificial vertex. Then we need to call dijkstras to find the shortest path from the original source to
the artificial target. This allows for the discovery of the shortest round-trip with minimal additional computation.

The **distPath** method modifies the output of getWeightPath method of Graph.

- In TrainRoutes if a path does not exists within the graph disPath returns "NO SUCH ROUTE" instead of -1.

The **numDiffPaths** method calls the getAllPathsBetween method of Graph but only returns the number of different paths, not
all the paths.

#### simple_util.py

It contains the file reading functions and formatting utility for feeding the data into the graphs.
